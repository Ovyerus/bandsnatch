# bandsnatch

> A CLI batch downloader for your Bandcamp collection.

Bandsnatch is a Rust tool for downloading all of your Bandcamp purchases all at
once in your desired format, and being able to be run multiple times when you
buy new releases.

This project is heavily inspired by Ezwen's
[bandcamp-collection-downloader](https://framagit.org/Ezwen/bandcamp-collection-downloader),
which I used myself before this, specifically existing to help me learn Rust,
but also to add some improvements over it that I've wanted.

## State of the Project

This tool is still currently a work in progress, so bugs and other weirdness may
occur. If anything weird happens or something breaks, please open an issue about
it with information and reproduction steps if possible. Specifically testing use
of this with large collections would be very helpful to see if there's any areas
that I need to improve in.

If you're a developer poking around in the code, please note that this is my
first proper project written using Rust, so code quality may be subpar,
especially in terms of memory usage. If you have any ideas to improve the
project in general I'd love to hear them.

## Usage

The most basic usage is along the lines of
`bandsnatch run -f <format> <username>`, as it will try to automatically fetch
cookies from a local `cookies.json`<!-- or from Firefox (TODO)-->. But if this
fails you can provide the `-c` option with a path to a cookies file to use.

For more advanced usage, you can run `bandsnatch run -h` to get output similar
to the following.

```
Run Bandsnatch to download your collection

Usage: bandsnatch run [OPTIONS] --format <AUDIO_FORMAT> <USER>

Arguments:
  <USER>  Name of the user to download releases from (must be logged in through cookies) [env: BS_USER=]

Options:
  -f, --format <AUDIO_FORMAT>   The audio format to download the files in [env: BS_FORMAT=] [possible values: flac, wav, aac-hi, mp3-320, aiff-lossless, vorbis, mp3-v0, alac]
  -c, --cookies <COOKIES_FILE>  [env: BS_COOKIES=]
      --debug                   Enables some extra debug output in certain scenarios [env: BS_DEBUG=]
  -d, --dry-run                 Return a list of all tracks to be downloaded, without actually downloading them
  -F, --force                   Ignores any found cache file and instead does a from-scratch download run [env: BS_FORCE=]
  -j, --jobs <JOBS>             The amount of parallel jobs (threads) to use [env: BS_JOBS=] [default: 4]
  -n, --limit <LIMIT>           Maximum number of releases to download. Useful for testing [env: BS_LIMIT=]
  -o, --output-folder <FOLDER>  The folder to extract downloaded releases to [env: BS_OUTPUT_FOLDER=] [default: ./]
  -h, --help                    Print help information
```

Besides these options, you can also use environment variables with the option
name in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, prefixed with `BS_`, so that if set up correctly
you can just run `bandsnatch run` and have it automatically download your
collection to the folder you want.

### Example

```
bandsnatch run -c ./cookies.json -f flac -o ./Music ovyerus
```

This would download my entire music collection into a local "Music" folder, and
also create a `bandcamp-collection-downloader.cache` in the same directory,
which then gets read on future runs in order to skip items it has already
retrieved.

## Authentication

Because Bandsnatch does not manage logging into Bandcamp itself, you need to
provide it the authentication cookies. For Firefox users, you can extract a
`cookies.json` with the
[Cookie Quick Manager extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-quick-manager/),
and on Chrome, you can use the
[Get cookies.txt LOCALLY extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc),
to extract the cookies in the Netscape format, which Bandsnatch also supports.

If you don't provide the `--cookies` option, Bandsnatch will attempt to
automatically find a file named `cookies.json` or `cookies.txt` in the local
directory and load it.

<!-- Failing that, if you use Firefox on Windows or Linux,
bandsnatch will try to automatically load the cookies from there if possible
(TODO). -->
